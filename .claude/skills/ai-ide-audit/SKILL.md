# IDE Support Audit

## Quick start

```
/ai-ide-audit all              # audit all platforms
/ai-ide-audit github-copilot   # Copilot only
/ai-ide-audit claude-code      # Claude Code only
/ai-ide-audit antigravity      # Antigravity app + agy CLI
/ai-ide-audit all --fix        # audit + auto-fix P0 issues
```

## Workflow

Strict evidence-based audit of IDE support in ai-engineering. No assumptions — every claim cites a file path. Output is always the structured audit document, no matter how many IDEs are requested.

1. **Write the report skeleton first** from `references/report-template.md` BEFORE collecting evidence.
2. **Dispatch a single `Explore` subagent** to read instruction surfaces, hook configs, mirror dirs, and `manifest.yml` counts.
3. **Classify each capability per platform** (SUPPORTED / PARTIAL / UNSUPPORTED) using the capability matrix.
4. **Run spec-107 advisory checks** (advisory-only per NG-11):
   - **Check 6** — agent naming consistency cross-IDE: every agent file's frontmatter `name:` must equal its slug.
   - **Check 8** — generic instruction-file count scan: walk every CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / copilot-instructions.md and validate `## Skills (N)` + `## Agents (N)` headers vs canonical counts.
5. **With `--fix`**, auto-remediate P0 issues only; re-run mirror sync; verify tests still pass.

> Detail: see [evidence collection (instruction surfaces, hooks, mirrors, sync script)](references/evidence-collection.md), [capability matrix + advisory checks + auto-fix policy](references/capability-matrix.md), [audit document skeleton](references/report-template.md).

## When to Use

- Verifying an IDE is genuinely wired end-to-end (instruction surface → hooks → skills → agents → installer).
- After any change to `scripts/sync_command_mirrors.py`, `src/ai_engineering/installer/templates.py`, or hook files.
- When skill or agent counts look wrong across IDEs.
- When a hook exists in `scripts/hooks/` but isn't firing.
- NOT for general code quality — use `/ai-verify`. NOT for security scanning — use `/ai-security`.

Step 0 (load contexts): read `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` `providers.stacks`; load `.ai-engineering/overrides/<stack>/conventions.md` for each stack and `.ai-engineering/overrides/_shared/conventions.md`; load `.ai-engineering/team/*.md` for team conventions.

## Common Mistakes

- Filling the matrix before collecting evidence (write the skeleton first).
- Marking SUPPORTED on partial wiring just because a file exists.
- Auto-fixing P1/P2 issues with `--fix` (it only touches P0).
- Skipping the post-fix unit test run.

## Examples

### Example 1 — full IDE sweep before a release

User: "audit every IDE we ship support for, then auto-fix the P0 issues"

```
/ai-ide-audit all --fix
```

Walks every IDE surface, scores SUPPORTED / PARTIAL / UNSUPPORTED per capability, fixes orphaned hooks and stale counts, re-runs mirror sync, re-runs unit tests.

### Example 2 — quick Copilot health check after sync

User: "did the sync_command_mirrors run leave Copilot in a good state?"

```
/ai-ide-audit github-copilot
```

Verifies `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/hooks/hooks.json`, `.github/skills/`, `.github/agents/` against the canonical formula and flags any drift.

## Integration

Triggered after: installer changes, `sync_command_mirrors.py` runs, new hooks added. Calls: `python scripts/sync_command_mirrors.py` (with `--fix`). Feeds into: `/ai-governance` (risk acceptance for UNSUPPORTED gaps). See also: `/ai-verify`, `/ai-security`.
