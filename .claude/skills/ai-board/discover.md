# Board Discover (subcommand of `/ai-board`)

> Detail file for `/ai-board discover`. The user-facing entry is `.claude/skills/ai-board/SKILL.md`. This file owns the procedural contract for one-time board-configuration discovery.

## Purpose

LLM-assisted post-install discovery of board configuration. Detects the team's project board setup, process template, state mappings, writable custom fields, documentation URLs, and CI/CD standards URLs. Writes discovered configuration atomically to manifest.yml.

## When to Use

- After initial framework install (`ai-eng install`)
- When board configuration changes (new project, new fields)
- Manual refresh: `/ai-board discover --refresh`. `--refresh` forces re-discovery even when board config already exists in manifest, overwriting previous values.
- Suggested by `/ai-start` when board config is missing

Step 0 (load contexts): read `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` `providers.stacks` and apply `.ai-engineering/overrides/<stack>/conventions.md` (informs field mapping conventions).

## Process

1. **Auth pre-flight + manifest** -- verify authentication (`gh auth status` or `az account show`); if not authenticated, report remediation and abort. Then read `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` `work_items` to determine active provider (`github` or `azure_devops`).

2. **Discover board** -- based on provider:

   **GitHub path**:
   a. Detect owner: if `github_project.owner` exists in manifest, use it. Otherwise, detect from git remote: `gh repo view --json owner -q '.owner.login'`
   b. List projects: `gh project list --owner <owner> --format json`
   c. If projects found, select the most relevant one (by name match or ask user if ambiguous)
   d. Discover fields: `gh project field-list <number> --owner <owner> --format json`
   e. Identify the Status field (single-select type) and extract its option IDs and names
   f. Map status options to lifecycle phases: refinement, ready, in_progress, in_review, done
   g. Discover writable custom fields (non-standard fields beyond Title, Status, Labels, Milestone)
   h. If NO Projects v2 found: configure labels fallback (see State Mapping Conventions below).

   **Azure DevOps path**:
   a. List process templates: `az boards work-item type list --project <project> -o json`
   b. Detect process template (Basic, Agile, Scrum, CMMI) from available work item types
   c. For each work item type, discover valid states: `az boards work-item type show --type <type> --project <project> -o json`
   d. Map states to lifecycle phases based on process template conventions
   e. Discover custom fields: `az boards work-item show --id <sample-id> --expand all -o json` (use any recent work item)

3. **Discover documentation URL** -- scan repo for docs configuration:
   - Check for: `mkdocs.yml`, `docusaurus.config.js`, `docs/conf.py`, `.readthedocs.yml`, `book.toml`
   - If found, extract the published URL from config or infer from repo name
   - Store in `documentation.external_portal` if not already set

4. **Discover CI/CD standards URL** -- scan for standards references:
   - Check `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `.azure-pipelines/` for comments referencing standards docs
   - Check manifest `cicd.standards_url` -- if null, search for common patterns
   - If found, prepare value for `cicd.standards_url`

5. **Build config atomically** -- assemble complete discovered configuration in memory:
   ```yaml
   state_mapping:
     refinement: "<discovered>"
     ready: "<discovered>"
     in_progress: "<discovered>"
     in_review: "<discovered>"
     done: "<discovered>"
   process_template: "<detected>"
   custom_fields:
     - id: "<field_id>"
       name: "<field_name>"
       type: "<field_type>"
   github_project:
     owner: "<detected_org_or_user>"
     number: <N>
     status_field_id: "<id>"
     status_options:
       refinement: "<option_id>"
       ready: "<option_id>"
       in_progress: "<option_id>"
       in_review: "<option_id>"
       done: "<option_id>"
   ```

6. **Write to manifest** -- ONLY write when all discovery succeeds. Partial failure means no write. Update `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` `work_items` section with discovered values. This data is later consumed by portable runbooks so they can populate provider-native writable fields without guessing the client's board shape.

7. **Report** -- present structured summary to user:
   ```
   Board Discovery Complete
   Provider: GitHub Projects v2
   Project: #4 "Engineering Board"
   States mapped: 5/5 (Triage -> refinement, Ready -> ready, ...)
   Custom fields: 3 (Priority, Size, Estimate)
   CI/CD standards: not found
   Docs URL: not found
   ```

## State Mapping Conventions

### GitHub Projects v2

| Lifecycle Phase | Common Status Names |
|----------------|-------------------|
| refinement | Triage, Backlog, New, Refinement |
| ready | Ready, To Do, Approved, Planned |
| in_progress | In Progress, Active, Doing, Working |
| in_review | In Review, Review, PR Review |
| done | Done, Closed, Complete, Shipped |

### Azure DevOps

| Lifecycle Phase | Agile | Scrum | CMMI |
|----------------|-------|-------|------|
| refinement | New | New | Proposed |
| ready | Approved | Approved | Active |
| in_progress | Active | Committed | Active |
| in_review | Resolved | Done | Resolved |
| done | Closed | Done | Closed |

### Labels Fallback (GitHub without Projects v2)

Uses labels with `status:` prefix: `status:refinement`, `status:ready`, `status:in-progress`, `status:in-review`, `status:done`.

## Common Mistakes

- Writing partial discovery results to manifest (violates atomic write protocol)
- Guessing state mappings without checking actual field options
- Not handling the case where Projects v2 exists but has no Status field
- Assuming field IDs are stable across projects (they are project-specific)

## Examples

### Example 1 — first-time discovery on GitHub project

User: "configure board sync for our GitHub Projects v2 board"

```
/ai-board discover
```

Detects the active Projects v2 board, queries Status field options, infers mapping from canonical phases (refinement/ready/in_progress/in_review/done), writes the config block atomically into `manifest.yml`.

### Example 2 — refresh after switching projects

User: "we just moved to a new ADO project — refresh the board config"

```
/ai-board discover --refresh
```

Forces re-discovery, overwrites the previous `work_items` block, validates writability of the configured fields.

## Integration

Called by: user directly, `/ai-start` (when config missing). Writes: `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` `work_items` section. Pairs with: `/ai-board sync` (consumes the config written here). See also: `/ai-autopilot --backlog` (board-driven backlog execution).
