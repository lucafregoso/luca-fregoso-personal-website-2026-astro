# Build

## Purpose

Execution engine for approved plans. Reads plan.md and tasks.md, dispatches one subagent per task (fresh context); each task self-validates via TDD; a single final quality loop runs verify+review plus one bounded quality-remediation pass on the full changeset before /ai-pr. If stuck: STOP and re-plan.

## When to Use

- After `/ai-plan` produces an approved plan
- To resume execution: `/ai-build --resume`
- Never without an approved plan (run `/ai-plan` first)

## Process

0. **Preflight dependencies** -- verify `.ai-engineering/specs/plan.md`, `.claude/skills/_shared/execution-kernel.md`, `.claude/skills/ai-build/handlers/quality.md`, and `.claude/skills/ai-build/handlers/deliver.md` exist. If any are missing: STOP and report the exact missing path(s). Never improvise missing orchestration logic.
0b. **Executor route gate (spec-145)** -- read plan frontmatter `status` and `execution_route.executor`. If `status` is not `approved`, STOP for operator approval. If `executor: autopilot`, refuse this `/ai-build` run, print `execution_route.safe_next_command` (normally `/ai-autopilot`), and STOP. If route metadata is absent, continue with legacy behavior.
1. **Board sync (in_progress)** -- read `.ai-engineering/specs/spec.md` frontmatter `refs`; for each work item ref where the hierarchy rule is not `never_close` (i.e., user_stories, tasks, bugs, issues), invoke `/ai-board sync in_progress <work-item-ref>`. Fail-open: do not block DAG construction if this fails. Then read `<spec_id>` from `spec.md` frontmatter `spec:` and call `python .ai-engineering/scripts/spec_lifecycle.py start <spec_id>` to transition the canonical sidecar APPROVED→IN_PROGRESS (mirrors `status: in-progress` into spec.md frontmatter). Fail-open: a non-zero exit logs and does NOT block DAG construction.
2. **Advise advisory** -- before dispatching any build task, invoke the Advise agent (`ai-advise`) in `gate` mode for governance advisory. Fail-open: if advise is unavailable or errors, log warning and continue -- never block dispatch.
2b. **Stack overrides routing (D-127-06 / sub-008, spec-128 D-128-01)** -- per task, call `tools.skill_app.deterministic_router.resolve_adapter(task_path, spec_stack)` to obtain the overrides directory under `.ai-engineering/overrides/<stack>/`. Pass the resolved path to the build agent so it loads `conventions.md`, `tdd_harness.md`, `security_floor.md`, and `examples/` into context before writing code. `spec_stack` precedence: spec frontmatter `stack:` field over file-extension inference. `UnknownStackError` halts the task with a clear "no overrides for this stack" message.
2c. **Model dispatch routing (D-131-08 / sub-003, §10.4 DRY)** -- per task, inspect the plan.md task block to pick the model tier. Decision matrix:
    * `Patch (deterministic):` present AND no synthesis-required hint → dispatch with `model_tier=haiku, effort=cheap` (cheap-tier, mechanical execution).
    * Patch absent OR synthesis hint present → dispatch with `model_tier=sonnet, effort=mid` (mid-tier, judgment required).
    * Operator opt-in `--max-effort` flag OR plan task tagged `architecture: true` → dispatch with `model_tier=opus, effort=high` (deep-architecture override).
    Pass the resolved tier to the build agent via env var `AIENG_MODEL_TIER`. Log the decision via `emit_agent_dispatched(..., metadata={"model_tier": <tier>, "effort": <effort>, "patch_present": <bool>})`. Investing in `/ai-plan` (high-tier, exhaustive patch-ready output) is what unlocks cheap-tier execution everywhere downstream (brief §2.6 / spec D-131-08).
2d. **No-HITL Contract (D-134-03)** -- if `--no-hitl` is set, read `handlers/no-hitl.md` and apply its contract: single-concern gate, `NEEDS_CONTEXT → BLOCKED` promotion, `quality_loop_blocked → exit 78`, `--no-watch` implied for delivery, no auto-retry. Default `/ai-build` behavior is unchanged when the flag is absent.
3. **Execute kernel**: see `.claude/skills/_shared/execution-kernel.md`. Build wraps each task with the kernel (Sub-flow 1 dispatch -> Sub-flow 2 build self-validation (TDD RED/GREEN/REFACTOR) -> Sub-flow 3 artifact collection -> Sub-flow 4 board sync). As each task reaches a terminal state, update `.ai-engineering/specs/plan.md` immediately before dispatching the next task. Do not defer checkbox/status writes to the end of the phase or the end of the spec. The pre/post wrappers above and below remain build-specific.
4. **Quality check** -- read `handlers/quality.md` and execute: Verify+Review on full changeset, single round, fail-loud with one bounded quality-remediation pass. Blocker/critical/high findings may be fixed once when scoped to quality-loop evidence; remaining blocker/critical/high findings → STOP + escalate (no second remediation pass).
5. **Deliver** -- read `handlers/deliver.md` and execute: PR via ai-pr with quality report.

## Resume Protocol

When invoked with `--resume`, use observable evidence only. Never guess hidden state. The build skill is the canonical implementation gateway (D-127-11) — replaces the legacy `/ai-build` slash command:

1. **Missing or placeholder plan**: if `.ai-engineering/specs/plan.md` is missing or still contains the placeholder `# No active plan`, STOP and run `/ai-plan`.
2. **Incomplete task execution**: if `.ai-engineering/specs/plan.md` still has unchecked task checkboxes, resume at the first incomplete phase. Skip completed tasks.
3. **Quality evidence missing**: if all task checkboxes are complete but `.ai-engineering/specs/plan.md` does not contain a `## Quality Outcome` section, resume at the Quality Check step. Read `handlers/quality.md`.
4. **Quality evidence present**: resume at the Deliver step. `handlers/deliver.md` is responsible for detecting whether an open PR already exists and either entering the watch-and-fix loop or creating/updating the PR.
5. **Conflicting evidence**: choose the earliest safe step and log why. Safety wins over convenience.

## Handler Dispatch Table

| Phase         | Handler               | Agent Pattern                       |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Quality Check | `handlers/quality.md` | Verify + Review parallel            |
| Deliver       | `handlers/deliver.md` | PR pipeline + cleanup               |
| No-HITL       | `handlers/no-hitl.md` | deterministic / single-concern only |

## Common Mistakes

- Dispatching without an approved plan.
- Giving subagents the entire codebase context (scope them tightly).
- Skipping the final quality loop after task execution.
- Continuing past a BLOCKED task without user input.
- Batch-updating `plan.md` only at the end instead of updating it when each task closes.
- Modifying test files from a RED phase during a GREEN phase task.
- Skipping the quality check after task execution.
- Invoking `--no-hitl` on a multi-concern plan; use `/ai-autopilot` instead.

## Examples

### Example 1 — start fresh execution

User: "the plan is approved, go"

```
/ai-build
```

Reads `plan.md`, dispatches one agent per task with fresh context; each task self-validates via TDD; final quality loop verifies the full changeset and may consume one bounded quality-remediation pass before handing off to `/ai-pr` for delivery.

### Example 2 — resume after interruption

User: "resume the build from where we crashed"

```
/ai-build --resume
```

Reads `plan.md`, identifies the next un-checked task, re-enters at the correct state.

## Integration

Called by: user directly post-`/ai-plan` approval. Calls: `ai-build` agent, `ai-verify`, `ai-review`, `/ai-pr`, `/ai-board sync`. Reads: `_shared/execution-kernel.md`. Transitions to: PR merge, or back to `/ai-plan`. See also: `/ai-autopilot` (multi-concern + `--backlog` for backlog), `/ai-resolve-conflicts`.
