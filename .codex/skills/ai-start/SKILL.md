# Start

## Purpose

Session welcome dashboard. The dashboard is fully rendered by a deterministic
Python script (`session_bootstrap.py`). The IDE agent does no per-field
derivation — it runs **exactly one command**, prints the markdown verbatim,
and stops.

Why this contract exists: re-probing git, sqlite, manifests, board APIs, etc.
from the IDE side blows the latency budget (operator-pain #18b). The script
collects every field, caches the board call (stale-while-revalidate), and
emits ready-to-display markdown. Cold path: < 3 s wall (with board). Warm
path: < 500 ms.

## Process

Run exactly this argv — literal, no flags moved or shells added — and print
its stdout verbatim:

```
uv run python .ai-engineering/scripts/session_bootstrap.py --format=markdown
```

That is the whole skill. The script is enrolled in the trusted-script lane
(`hooks-manifest.json` `trustedArgvs`, D-131-12) so this exact argv bypasses
RTK rewriting and IOC re-evaluation. Any other invocation form (positional
flag order changes, plain `python3`, missing `--format`) falls back to the
full IOC path and degrades latency.

### Hard rules

- Do **not** read the manifest, run `git`, query `sqlite`, hit `gh`, glob
  the skills/agents tree, or count `LESSONS.md` from the agent side. The
  script already did all of that and embedded the result inside the
  markdown payload.
- Do **not** rewrite the markdown the script emits. The format is the
  cross-IDE contract (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Copilot all render
  the same bytes).
- Do **not** invoke `/ai-session-watch` from inside this skill. Observation is
  always-on via the `PreToolUse` + `PostToolUse` hooks (`instinct-
  observe.py`) and consolidated at session end by the `Stop` hook
  (`instinct-extract.py`). The dashboard surfaces an `N to review`
  CTA when the unconsolidated backlog exceeds the
  `observations/meta.json` `deltaThreshold` — operators run
  `/ai-session-watch --review` manually when they see that CTA.

### What the dashboard already contains

Trust the markdown the script emits. It surfaces every field the
operator typically asks for next:

- **Project identity**: the CONSTITUTION mission as the tagline.
- **Stack posture**: `surfaces.enabled` ·
  `gates.mode` — visible in one line so layer drift is obvious.
- **Counts**: skills, agents, lessons, active decisions, accepted
  risks, recent_events_7d.
- **Active work**: spec id + state + title, plan status (including the
  `shipped-pending-pr-merge` exemption per `plan-schema.md`),
  task progress.
- **Recent commits**: last 5 SHA + subject from `git log`.
- **Recent lessons**: last 3 `### ` headers from `LESSONS.md` with a
  gist line (no `**Context**:` prefix noise — stripped server-side).
- **Board**: full per-status breakdown via paginated GraphQL (no
  sample-size truncation).
- **Compatibility**: a `### ⚠ Compatibility` block appears only when
  the manifest deviates from defaults (today: `gates.mode != regulated`).

Do not duplicate or re-render any of these from the agent side.

### Board behaviour

The script handles the `gh project item-list` call with a hard 4 s
subprocess timeout and a stale-while-revalidate cache at
`.ai-engineering/runtime/board-cache.json` (fresh ≤ 60 s, stale-allowed up
to 5 min). On board failure the JSON includes `board_summary.unavailable:
true` and the markdown shows `board unavailable (reason)` — never blocks
the rest of the dashboard.

### When the script is unavailable

If the script exits non-zero or the venv has no `uv`, fall back to a
one-line banner: `ai-start unavailable — repo not bootstrapped, run \`ai-eng
install\`.` Do **not** reconstruct the dashboard by hand.

## Examples

### Example 1 — morning bootstrap

```
/ai-start
```

Runs the script, prints the dashboard, stops. The dashboard already lists
the active spec, last 5 commits, board items by status, project counts,
and the quick-action chips.

### Example 2 — mid-session re-bootstrap after `/clear`

```
/ai-start
```

Same single command. The board cache (if still fresh) makes this nearly
instantaneous.

## Integration

- **Called by**: user directly; IDE instruction files (FIRST ACTION mandate
  per CONSTITUTION).
- **Calls**: `session_bootstrap.py --format=markdown` (only).
- **Does not call**: `/ai-session-watch`, `/ai-board discover`, manifest readers,
  or any other skill. Suggestions (e.g. "no active spec — run
  `/ai-brainstorm`") are embedded inside the markdown the script emits.
- **See also**: `/ai-onboard` (human onboarding, different audience),
  `/ai-branch-cleanup` (pre-start hygiene).
