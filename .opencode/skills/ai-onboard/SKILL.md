Trigger for 'where does auth happen', 'what is the architecture here', 'history of this decision', 'onboard me to this repo', 'tour the codebase'. Not for agent session bootstrap; use /ai-start instead. Not for code-level explanation; use /ai-explain instead."

# Onboard

## Quick start

```
/ai-onboard tour                # architecture overview
/ai-onboard find auth           # find where auth happens
/ai-onboard history DEC-003     # decision archaeology
/ai-onboard onboard             # structured new-member onboarding
```

## Workflow

Project onboarding, architecture tours, and decision archaeology. Optimized for the human, not the code. Reads everything, modifies nothing. Teaches understanding, not artifacts.

1. **`tour`** — Glob/identify directories, entry points, config; detect stack; present overview with ASCII diagram (component boundaries, dependencies, data flow); explain key patterns; `git log --oneline` for evolution; flag gotchas; suggest next paths.
2. **`find [topic]`** — Grep/Glob across source/config/docs; check `decision-store.json` and `.ai-engineering/specs/`; present file:line refs and context; answer "where does X happen?".
3. **`history [decision]`** — search `decision-store.json`, `git log --all --grep`, and `specs/`; reconstruct what was known, constraints, alternatives considered; assess current relevance; **do NOT recommend** — present analysis, let developer decide.
4. **`onboard`** — map structure; identify stack; discover patterns; find key files; review `.ai-engineering/standards/`; Socratic checkpoint per phase; personalize path to developer's interest.

## Dispatch threshold

Dispatch the `ai-onboard` agent for any human-onboarding, archaeology, or codebase-tour request. Strictly read-only. The agent file (`.codex/agents/ai-onboard.md`) is the dispatch handle; mode procedures and pedagogical principles live here.

## When to Use

- New to a project and need orientation.
- Want to understand component relationships and data flow.
- Asking "why was X chosen over Y?".
- NOT for writing code — use `/ai-build`.
- NOT for generating docs — use `/ai-prose`.

## Common Mistakes

- Making decisions for the developer — present tradeoffs, let them decide.
- Writing code during a tour — guide is strictly read-only.
- Over-quizzing — max 2 Socratic questions per interaction.
- Teaching below the developer's level — match cues to Bloom's taxonomy.

## Examples

### Example 1 — onboard a new team member

User: "give me an architecture tour of this repo, I'm new"

```
/ai-onboard tour
```

High-level overview, module ownership map, key boundaries, suggested deeper-dive paths. Read-only.

### Example 2 — decision archaeology

User: "why did we choose hexagonal architecture for this codebase?"

```
/ai-onboard history hexagonal-architecture
```

Reads `decision-store.json` for the matching record, surfaces the original tradeoffs, links to the spec or commit that ratified it.

## Integration

Calls: `/ai-explain` (3-tier depth). Reads: `decision-store.json`, `framework-events.ndjson`, `manifest.yml`. See also: `/ai-start` (agent session bootstrap), `/ai-explain` (code-level), `/ai-research` (external evidence).
