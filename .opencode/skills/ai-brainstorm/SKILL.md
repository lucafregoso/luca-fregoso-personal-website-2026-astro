# Brainstorm

## Purpose

Design interrogation skill. Forces rigorous thinking BEFORE any code is written. Produces an approved spec that becomes the contract for `/ai-plan`.

HARD GATE: this skill produces a spec. No implementation happens until the user explicitly approves it.

## When to Use

- User says "I want to build...", "how should we...", "let's design..."
- New feature, architecture change, or ambiguous requirement
- The spec depends on evidence scattered across multiple repo or governance surfaces
- Any work where jumping straight to code would be premature

## Process

-1. **Live-slot guard** (D-167-05) — UNLESS invoked with `--consolidate-spec`,
   run `python .ai-engineering/scripts/spec_lifecycle.py slot_status` BEFORE any
   `spec.md` write (Step 6 and the Step 0b condensed-spec path both write it).
   If the JSON reports `occupied: true` AND `state` is not `shipped`, the slot
   already holds an un-shipped spec — surface its `spec_id`, `slug`, and `state`
   and ask the operator to either consolidate it first
   (`/ai-brainstorm --consolidate-spec <slug>`) or explicitly confirm the
   overwrite. On `occupied: false`, a `shipped` state, or any script error,
   proceed silently. **Fail-open**: this guard is advisory and never blocks
   interrogation — a non-zero exit logs and continues.
0a. **Fast-path — `--consolidate-spec <slug>`**: when invoked with the
   `--consolidate-spec` flag, read `.codex/skills/_shared/consolidate-spec.md`
   and execute the shared handler (resolve record, append `_history.md` row
   via `spec_lifecycle.py mark_shipped`, clear `spec.md`/`plan.md` to
   placeholders). STOP after consolidation — no interrogation runs. Fail-open
   on missing script.
0b. **Auto-spec gate** — follow `handlers/auto-spec-gate.md`. Classify the
   working-tree diff via `ai_engineering.brainstorm.auto_spec_gate.classify_diff`
   BEFORE interrogation begins. If any hard trigger fires, OR any threshold is
   exceeded, route to full interrogation (continue to Step 1). Otherwise, take
   the condensed-spec path: draft the minimum-viable spec from the diff,
   present it for one-shot approval, STOP at Step 7. Honor
   `manifest.brainstorm.auto_spec_gate.enabled: false` as a no-op (fail-open
   to full interrogation).
0. **Spec lifecycle bootstrap** (before evidence sweep) — call
   `python .ai-engineering/scripts/spec_lifecycle.py start_new <slug> <title>`
   to mint (or no-op refresh) the DRAFT record under
   `.ai-engineering/state/specs/<slug>.json`. **Fail-open**: if the script
   exits non-zero (missing dependency, locked sidecar), log the failure and
   continue — interrogation must not be blocked by lifecycle plumbing.
1. **Work item context** (only when a work item ID is provided, e.g., `AB#100` or `#45`):
   a. Read `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` `work_items` section for active provider and team config
   b. Fetch work item and its hierarchy from the provider: - **GitHub**: `gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,milestone,assignees` - **Azure DevOps**: `az boards work-item show --id <number> --expand relations -o json`
   c. Walk the hierarchy: Feature → User Story → Tasks (follow parent/child relations)
   d. Use all standard and custom fields the platform provides
   e. Pre-fill `refs` section in the generated spec frontmatter
   f. Invoke `/ai-board sync refinement <work-item-ref>` to transition the work item to refinement state (fail-open: do not block brainstorm if this fails)
2. **Enhance input** -- follow `handlers/prompt-enhance.md` to evaluate and optimize user input for clarity and specificity before interrogation
3. **Evidence sweep** -- when the current state spans multiple repo or governance surfaces, dispatch parallel read-only `ai-explore` passes first, summarize the findings, and use that evidence to sharpen the next question or spec boundary
4. **Interrogate** -- follow `handlers/interrogate.md` for the questioning flow
5. **Propose approaches** -- present 2-3 options with trade-offs (never just one). Scope classification is already settled at Step 0b — there is no post-interrogation file-count heuristic.
6. **Draft spec** -- write spec to `.ai-engineering/specs/spec.md`. Then run the **Step 0.5 — Section pre-flight** (deterministic gate) **before** any LLM validation pass: invoke `ai-eng spec verify --sections .ai-engineering/specs/spec.md` (spec-139 M7). The CLI runs a regex/string-contains scan for the five required headers (`## Summary`, `## Goals`, `## Non-Goals`, `## Decisions`, `## Risks`) and emits JSON with `valid`, `missing_sections`, `present_sections`. Exit 1 short-circuits the LLM validation — patch the missing headers and re-run before continuing. Only when the script reports `valid=true` proceed to the LLM-driven schema validation against `.ai-engineering/reference/spec-schema.md`.
7. **Board sync (ready)** -- if a work item ID was provided in step 1, invoke `/ai-board sync ready <work-item-ref>` to transition the work item to ready state (fail-open: do not block brainstorm if this fails)
8. **Review spec** -- follow `handlers/spec-review.md` for the review loop (max 3 iterations)
9. **STOP** -- present the spec for approval. At the moment the operator
   approves, call `python .ai-engineering/scripts/spec_lifecycle.py approve <spec_id>`
   (read `<spec_id>` from the spec frontmatter `spec:`, fallback `slug:`) to
   transition the canonical sidecar DRAFT→APPROVED, which also mirrors
   `status: approved` into `spec.md` frontmatter. **Fail-open** (D-161-08): a
   non-zero exit logs and does NOT block the STOP. Then present the approved
   spec — User runs `/ai-plan` to continue.

## Questioning Rules

- ONE question at a time. Never batch.
- Prefer multiple choice (A/B/C) over open-ended.
- Challenge vague language: "improve", "optimize", "clean up" are not requirements.
- Push back on scope creep. Ask: "Is this in scope for v1?"
- Explore edge cases the user has not mentioned.
- Max 10 questions per session. If you need more, the problem is too big -- split it.
- When the user's input requires research to understand the current state (e.g.,
  audits, "is this working?", "how is X organized?"), gather data first, present
  findings, THEN interrogate. Research is not interrogation -- it precedes it.

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping interrogation and jumping to the spec.
- Proposing only one approach (always propose 2-3).
- Writing implementation details in the spec (specs describe WHAT, not HOW).
- Not challenging the user's assumptions.
- Producing a spec without the review loop.

## Integration

- **Called by**: user directly, or `/ai-plan` when requirements are unclear
- **Calls**: `handlers/auto-spec-gate.md` (Step 0b trivial-vs-spec classifier via `ai_engineering.brainstorm.auto_spec_gate.classify_diff`), `handlers/prompt-enhance.md`, `handlers/interrogate.md`, `handlers/spec-review.md`, `/ai-board sync` (refinement + ready transitions), `.ai-engineering/scripts/spec_lifecycle.py start_new` (fail-open lifecycle bootstrap), `.ai-engineering/scripts/spec_lifecycle.py approve` (Step 9 DRAFT→APPROVED on operator approval, fail-open)
- **Transitions to**: `/ai-plan` (ONLY -- never directly to `ai-build` or `/ai-build`)

## Examples

### Example 1 — design a new feature from a vague request

User: "lets add multi-tenant support"

```
/ai-brainstorm "multi-tenant support"
```

Interrogates: what's the isolation model? per-row, per-schema, per-database? What about data residency? Existing user migration? Produces an approved spec at `.ai-engineering/specs/spec.md` with decisions recorded.

### Example 2 — resolve ambiguity in a work item

User: "AB#456 says 'improve search performance' — what does that even mean?"

```
/ai-brainstorm AB#456
```

Pulls the work item, surfaces ambiguity, drives the user to specific measurable acceptance criteria, links the spec to the work item.
