"""Bounded-retry NDJSON append helper for hook-side audit-grade writers.

Spec-126 D-126-05: closes the hook-side multi-IDE concurrent-append race
(POSIX ``O_APPEND`` masks the bug locally, Windows offers no atomic
guarantee). Wraps a single-line append in
``artifact_lock(project_root, lock_name)`` with bounded retry. On
exhaustion, falls open: appends unlocked and records a
``framework_error`` to a sidecar ``lock-failures.ndjson`` artifact so
the failure record cannot itself recurse into the same race.

The helper is intentionally placed in its OWN module rather than added
to ``_lib/locking.py`` so that the byte-level parity gate
(``tests/unit/hooks/test_locking_parity.py``, spec-126 D-126-01) keeps
``_lib/locking.py`` a pure mirror of the pkg-side primitive.

Phase 3 (spec-126 T-3.0) added :func:`with_lock_retry` — a context
manager mirror of :func:`locked_append` that exposes the lock-acquired
state to the caller. Writers that compute ``prev_event_hash`` from the
file tail must hold the lock while computing the hash AND writing
(otherwise two concurrent writers can observe the same prev value and
append duplicate-pointer entries — the same TOCTOU the spec exists to
fix). :func:`locked_append` is preserved as a thin wrapper for simple
single-line writers.

Stdlib + ``_lib.locking`` only — no transitive ``ai_engineering``
package imports (Article V hook-standalone contract).

    its sidecar adjacent to the caller-supplied ``path``. The two

    single-line appenders) and the sidecar location reflects that.

    Implementation note (spec-126 T-3.0): this function intentionally
    duplicates the acquire-retry-fail-open loop from
    :func:`with_lock_retry` rather than delegating to it. The
    duplication preserves a per-call invariant required by the
    Phase-2 sidecar contract: the fail-open sidecar
    (``lock-failures.ndjson``) is emitted **next to** ``path`` for
    generic callers. :func:`with_lock_retry`, by contrast, always
    emits its sidecar adjacent to the canonical
    ``framework-events.ndjson`` because it is only used by chain
    writers operating on that file. Consolidating into a single
    primitive would force all callers into one sidecar location;
    keeping the loops parallel preserves both surfaces while sharing
    the helper primitives (``_emit_lock_failure``, ``_locking``).
