# Governance Drift

## Objective

Detect configuration and content drift between framework-managed surfaces: IDE mirror sync, quality gate thresholds, hook script integrity, manifest internal consistency, and template-vs-installed divergence. Runs weekly and produces task work items for every verified drift finding. This runbook is strictly read-only against framework files -- it reports drift but never auto-fixes it.

## Prerequisites

- `python3` with `pyyaml` installed for manifest parsing.
- `shasum` available for hook integrity verification.
- `diff` available for file comparison.
- `gh` or `az` CLI authenticated for work item creation.
- `scripts/sync_command_mirrors.py` present for mirror sync checks.
- `ai-eng` CLI is optional; Step 3 provides equivalent manual checks when unavailable.

## Procedure

### Step 1 -- Run mirror sync check

Verify that `.claude/` canonical sources are in sync with their mirrors in `.codex/`, `.github/`, and `src/ai_engineering/templates/`.

```bash
python scripts/sync_command_mirrors.py --check
```

Exit code 0 means all mirrors match. Exit code 1 means drift exists -- capture the diff output listing each file with a content mismatch. Record every drifted file path and its mirror counterpart.

### Step 2 -- Run ai-eng governance verification

When the `ai-eng` CLI is available, run the built-in governance check for a structured report.

```bash
ai-eng verify governance --json
```

Parse the JSON output. Each finding includes a category, severity, file path, and remediation hint. Store findings in the working set for Step 8.

### Step 3 -- Fallback: manual mirror consistency check

When `ai-eng` is unavailable, verify mirror parity manually. For each skill in `.claude/skills/ai-*/SKILL.md`, confirm the corresponding file exists and matches in all three mirror targets.

```bash
# List canonical skills
ls .claude/skills/ai-*/SKILL.md | while read -r canonical; do
  SKILL=$(basename "$(dirname "$canonical")")
  SKILL_SHORT="${SKILL#ai-}"

  # Check .codex/ mirror
  CODEX_MIRROR=".codex/skills/ai-$SKILL_SHORT/SKILL.md"
  if [ ! -f "$CODEX_MIRROR" ]; then
    echo "DRIFT [missing] $CODEX_MIRROR (canonical: $canonical)"
  elif ! diff -q "$canonical" "$CODEX_MIRROR" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "DRIFT [content] $CODEX_MIRROR differs from $canonical"
  fi

  # Check .github/ mirror
  GITHUB_MIRROR=".github/skills/$SKILL/SKILL.md"
  if [ ! -f "$GITHUB_MIRROR" ]; then
    echo "DRIFT [missing] $GITHUB_MIRROR (canonical: $canonical)"
  elif ! diff -q "$canonical" "$GITHUB_MIRROR" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "DRIFT [content] $GITHUB_MIRROR differs from $canonical"
  fi
done

# Repeat for agents
ls .claude/agents/ai-*.md | while read -r canonical; do
  AGENT=$(basename "$canonical")
  for MIRROR_DIR in .codex/agents .github/agents; do
    if [ ! -f "$MIRROR_DIR/$AGENT" ]; then
      echo "DRIFT [missing] $MIRROR_DIR/$AGENT"
    elif ! diff -q "$canonical" "$MIRROR_DIR/$AGENT" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "DRIFT [content] $MIRROR_DIR/$AGENT differs from $canonical"
    fi
  done
done
```

### Step 4 -- Check quality gate thresholds

Read `manifest.yml` and verify that quality gate values match the expected baselines defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

```bash
python3 -c "
import yaml, sys, pathlib

manifest = yaml.safe_load(pathlib.Path('.ai-engineering/manifest.yml').read_text())
quality = manifest.get('quality', {})

expected = {'coverage': 80, 'duplication': 3, 'cyclomatic': 10, 'cognitive': 15}
drift = []

for key, want in expected.items():
    got = quality.get(key)
    if got is None:
        drift.append(f'DRIFT [missing] quality.{key}: expected {want}, not set')
    elif got != want:
        drift.append(f'DRIFT [threshold] quality.{key}: expected {want}, found {got}')

if drift:
    print('\n'.join(drift))
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print('Quality gates OK')
"
```

### Step 5 -- Verify hook integrity

Check that installed hook scripts have not been modified by comparing their SHA-256 hashes against the source copies in `scripts/hooks/`.

```bash
for HOOK_SRC in scripts/hooks/*; do
  HOOK_NAME=$(basename "$HOOK_SRC")
  HOOK_INSTALLED=".git/hooks/$HOOK_NAME"

  if [ ! -f "$HOOK_INSTALLED" ]; then
    echo "DRIFT [missing] $HOOK_INSTALLED not installed (source: $HOOK_SRC)"
    continue
  fi

  SRC_HASH=$(shasum -a 256 "$HOOK_SRC" | cut -d' ' -f1)
  INST_HASH=$(shasum -a 256 "$HOOK_INSTALLED" | cut -d' ' -f1)

  if [ "$SRC_HASH" != "$INST_HASH" ]; then
    echo "DRIFT [integrity] $HOOK_INSTALLED hash mismatch (expected: ${SRC_HASH:0:12}..., found: ${INST_HASH:0:12}...)"
  fi
done
```

### Step 6 -- Check template-vs-installed drift

Compare framework-managed files under `src/ai_engineering/templates/project/` against their installed counterparts in the repository root. Only check files that the framework owns (paths listed in `manifest.yml` under `ownership.framework`).

```bash
TEMPLATE_ROOT="src/ai_engineering/templates/project"

# Compare .claude/ templates against installed
find "$TEMPLATE_ROOT/.claude" -type f | while read -r tmpl; do
  RELATIVE="${tmpl#$TEMPLATE_ROOT/}"
  if [ ! -f "$RELATIVE" ]; then
    echo "DRIFT [missing] $RELATIVE not installed (template: $tmpl)"
  elif ! diff -q "$tmpl" "$RELATIVE" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "DRIFT [template] $RELATIVE differs from template $tmpl"
  fi
done

# Compare .codex/, .agents/ and .github/ templates
for SURFACE in .codex .agents .github; do
  find "$TEMPLATE_ROOT/$SURFACE" -type f 2>/dev/null | while read -r tmpl; do
    RELATIVE="${tmpl#$TEMPLATE_ROOT/}"
    if [ ! -f "$RELATIVE" ]; then
      echo "DRIFT [missing] $RELATIVE not installed"
    elif ! diff -q "$tmpl" "$RELATIVE" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "DRIFT [template] $RELATIVE differs from template"
    fi
  done
done
```

### Step 7 -- Verify manifest internal consistency

Check that every skill and agent declared in `manifest.yml` has a corresponding file on disk, and that no orphaned files exist without a registry entry.

```bash
python3 -c "
import yaml, pathlib, sys

manifest = yaml.safe_load(pathlib.Path('.ai-engineering/manifest.yml').read_text())
drift = []

# Check skill registry vs disk
registry = manifest.get('skills', {}).get('registry', {})
for skill_name in registry:
    skill_path = pathlib.Path(f'.claude/skills/{skill_name}/SKILL.md')
    if not skill_path.exists():
        drift.append(f'DRIFT [orphan-registry] {skill_name} in manifest but no file at {skill_path}')

# Check disk vs skill registry
for skill_dir in sorted(pathlib.Path('.claude/skills').iterdir()):
    if skill_dir.is_dir() and (skill_dir / 'SKILL.md').exists():
        if skill_dir.name not in registry:
            drift.append(f'DRIFT [unregistered] {skill_dir.name} on disk but not in manifest registry')

# Check agent names vs disk
agent_names = manifest.get('agents', {}).get('names', [])
for agent in agent_names:
    agent_path = pathlib.Path(f'.claude/agents/ai-{agent}.md')
    if not agent_path.exists():
        drift.append(f'DRIFT [orphan-registry] agent {agent} in manifest but no file at {agent_path}')

# Check disk vs agent registry
for agent_file in sorted(pathlib.Path('.claude/agents').glob('ai-*.md')):
    name = agent_file.stem.replace('ai-', '')
    if name not in agent_names:
        drift.append(f'DRIFT [unregistered] agent {name} on disk but not in manifest')

# Check declared totals
actual_skills = len(registry)
declared_skills = manifest.get('skills', {}).get('total', 0)
if actual_skills != declared_skills:
    drift.append(f'DRIFT [count] skills.total: declared {declared_skills}, registry has {actual_skills}')

actual_agents = len(agent_names)
declared_agents = manifest.get('agents', {}).get('total', 0)
if actual_agents != declared_agents:
    drift.append(f'DRIFT [count] agents.total: declared {declared_agents}, list has {actual_agents}')

if drift:
    print('\n'.join(drift))
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print('Manifest consistency OK')
"
```

### Step 8 -- Map findings and deduplicate via handler

Map each drift finding from Steps 1-7 to the Finding contract and route through the shared dedup handler.

**Finding mapping:**

```yaml
domain_label: "governance-drift"
title: "[governance-drift] $DRIFT_TYPE: $FILE_PATH"
file_path: $FILE_PATH
rule_id: $DRIFT_TYPE (mirror-sync | threshold | hook-integrity | template-drift | manifest-consistency)
symbol: null
severity: threshold/hook-integrity = high, mirror-sync/template-drift = medium, manifest-consistency = medium
body: |
  ## Governance Drift Finding

  **Category:** $CATEGORY
  **Drift type:** $DRIFT_TYPE
  **File:** $FILE_PATH
  **Expected:** $EXPECTED_VALUE
  **Actual:** $ACTUAL_VALUE
  **Remediation:** $ACTION

  **Detected by:** governance-drift runbook
```

Follow `handlers/dedup-check.md` to process all findings through the dedup cascade (max 15 per run).

### Step 9 -- Generate report

Produce a structured report summarizing all findings and the overall framework health score.

```
=== Governance Drift Report ===
Date:          2026-03-28T00:00:00Z
Drift files:   4 (threshold: 0)
Total findings: 7 / 15 max

By category:
  Mirror sync:          2
  Quality thresholds:   0
  Hook integrity:       1
  Template drift:       3
  Manifest consistency: 1

Framework health score: 86/100
  Mirror parity:        -6  (2 files drifted)
  Gate config:           0  (all thresholds match)
  Hook integrity:       -3  (1 hook modified)
  Template alignment:   -3  (3 files diverged)
  Manifest consistency: -2  (1 orphan entry)

Items created: 7
Mutations used: 7 / 15
```

The health score starts at 100 and deducts points per finding: mirror sync -3/file, threshold -5/gate, hook integrity -3/hook, template drift -1/file, manifest inconsistency -2/entry. A score below 70 indicates the framework needs immediate remediation.

## Output

Framework health score and findings to stdout. Work items created for drift findings. No local files are written.

## Guardrails

1. **Never auto-fixes drift.** This runbook detects and reports drift. It does not run `sync_command_mirrors.py` without `--check`, does not overwrite framework files, and does not modify hook scripts.
2. **Never modifies framework files.** No write operations target `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.github/`, `.ai-engineering/`, or `src/ai_engineering/templates/`. Remediation is delegated to a human or to `sync_command_mirrors.py` (without `--check`) after review.
3. **Mutations enabled by default.** Work items are created automatically.
4. **Bounded mutations.** A maximum of 15 work items are created per run. If findings exceed this limit, the report notes the overflow and stops creating items.
5. **Protected states.** Items in `closed` or `resolved` state are never reopened or modified. Labels `p1-critical` and `pinned` are never removed.
6. **Idempotent.** Deduplication is delegated to the shared handler (`handlers/dedup-check.md`), which checks consolidated issues first, then individual issues, before creating new items.
