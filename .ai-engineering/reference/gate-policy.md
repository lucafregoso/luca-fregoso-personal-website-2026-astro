# Gate policy: local fast-slice + CI authoritative (spec-104 D-104-02)

## Purpose

`/ai-commit` and `/ai-pr` need to feel fast without weakening any gate. Pre-spec-104,
the local pre-push block ran six checks sequentially plus a duplicate of the CI matrix
(`semgrep` + `pip-audit` + `pytest` full + `ty` again) for a 3-5 min cold-cache wall
clock. spec-104 splits that work into two layers:

- **Local fast-slice** -- a curated set of checks that protect minimum integrity and
  fit within a ~60 s budget on warm cache.
- **CI authoritative** -- the full check matrix, run before merge with auto-complete
  blocked until green. CI is the shift-left of production, not a redundant repeat of
  the local layer.

This document is the single source of truth for *which* checks live where and *why*.
It is read at session start by `/ai-start` so every IDE driver (Claude Code, GitHub
Copilot, Codex, Antigravity) sees the same policy.

## Local fast-slice (~60 s budget)

The `ai-eng gate run --cache-aware` orchestrator runs these five checks (Wave 1
fixers serial, Wave 2 checkers parallel). Each check has a budget contract: a soft
target the orchestrator measures against and surfaces in `wall_clock_ms` on
`gate-findings.json`.

| Check | Wave | Budget (warm) | Budget (cold) | Cache-aware |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gitleaks protect --staged` | 2 | 1 s | 3 s | yes |
| `ruff format` + `ruff check --fix` | 1 | 2 s | 6 s | yes |
| `ty check src/` | 2 | 5 s | 15 s | yes |
| `pytest -m smoke` | 2 | 8 s | 25 s | yes |
| `ai-eng validate` | 2 | 2 s | 5 s | yes (skipped if `.ai-engineering/` unchanged) |
| docs gate (LLM dispatch) | 2 | 10 s | 30 s | no (non-deterministic) |

Sum of cold-cache budgets is ~84 s, but Wave 2 runs in parallel so realised
wall-clock is `max(individual)` ~30-40 s plus Wave 1 ~6 s ~= ~40-50 s. The
60 s budget includes git overhead and orchestrator bookkeeping.

## CI authoritative

The CI workflow runs the local five plus three more checks that intentionally do not
run locally:

| Check | Local | CI | Why CI only |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gitleaks protect --staged` | yes | yes (full-source) | local is staged, CI is full-source |
| `ruff format` + `ruff check` | yes | yes (lint job) | parity guard |
| `ty check src/` | yes | yes (typecheck job) | parity guard |
| `pytest -m smoke` | yes | covered by full unit job | redundant on CI |
| `ai-eng validate` | yes | yes (content-integrity job) | parity guard |
| docs gate (LLM) | yes | no | non-deterministic; would flake CI |
| `semgrep` | no | yes (security job) | full-source needs holding 30+ s |
| `pip-audit` | no | yes (security job) | network access available on runner |
| `pytest` full + matrix | no | yes (test job, 3 OS x 3 Py) | matrix duplicates local cost |

CI is the shift-left of production: `auto_merge` stays blocked until every CI check
passes. The watch loop in `/ai-pr` autofixes residual CI failures (existing
mechanism, unchanged). No gate is weakened -- the gate still runs before merge,
only the *moment* moves from `git push` to `git push + 90 s of CI`.

## Why this is not configurable

The split is fixed at the framework level. There is no `manifest.yml` knob to add
`semgrep` to the local fast-slice or remove `pytest -m smoke`. Reasons:

- LESSONS rule: "stable framework orchestration should not become per-project
  config by default." Each per-project switch creates a drift surface where one
  project's policy diverges from the framework's contract.
- Mirror drift across IDEs. Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, and Antigravity all
  consume the same `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`,
  `.agents/skills/` mirrors. A configurable policy would have to be re-read per
  IDE driver, multiplying the surface area for skew.
- Audit traceability. Regulated consumers (banking, healthcare) need a single
  policy artefact that auditors can read in five minutes. A per-project knob means
  per-project audit.

A team that legitimately needs a different cut may fork this context file and
override via the `contexts.precedence: [team, frameworks, languages]` ordering in
`manifest.yml`. The fork is visible, versioned, and reviewable -- a knob is not.

## Error-handling posture (fail-open vs fail-closed)

Every check, hook, and plumbing path makes one of two choices when it cannot
complete: **fail closed** (block) or **fail open** (log and continue). The choice
is not taste -- it is fixed by *blast radius if the path is wrong or absent*:

- **Security / integrity boundaries fail CLOSED.** Secret scanning (the
  `gitleaks` / `semgrep` / `pip-audit` gates, BLOCK at MEDIUM and above),
  hook-integrity verification (`AIENG_HOOK_INTEGRITY_MODE`, default `enforce`),
  and the MCP health gate (`AIE_MCP_HEALTH_FAIL_OPEN` defaults closed) all BLOCK
  when they cannot run. A scanner that cannot execute is **not** a pass -- an
  un-checkable secret is a leaked secret, and unverified hook bytes are untrusted
  code.
- **Framework plumbing fails OPEN, and must LOG.** Lifecycle sidecars
  (`spec_lifecycle.py`), `/ai-board` sync, telemetry, advisory hooks, version
  checks, doctor probes, and instinct extraction log the failure and continue. A
  `/ai-brainstorm` session must never die because a JSON sidecar is locked.
- **Never silently swallow.** A fail-open path that catches broadly **without
  logging** is the actual anti-pattern -- not the broad `except` itself. The log
  line is what turns a swallowed error into an observable one.
- **A security gate that cannot run is a fail-open hole -- a bug, not a design.**
  `docs/ci-branch-protection.md` and `docs/supply-chain-control-matrix.md` spell
  this out: a required gate the aggregate never inspects silently regresses the
  whole policy. Treat any fail-open on a security boundary as a defect.

A path that *hardens* an otherwise-open default to closed exposes a tunable
(`AIENG_IOC_FAIL_CLOSED` makes the IOC denylist fail closed on a missing or
corrupt `iocs.json`, default off); the baseline posture still follows the
blast-radius rule above.

**Mechanical backing, not a blanket lint.** `ruff` `TRY004` (raise the correct
exception type) and `TRY400` (`logging.exception` preserves the traceback) back
the "log, don't swallow" half. `BLE001` (blind-except) is deliberately **not**
enabled: it would force suppression on the intentional fail-open plumbing layer,
which the no-suppression hard rule forbids. Audited deviations are recorded inline
with `# audit:exempt:<reason>` markers (e.g.
`audit:exempt:typer-cli-3-fail-closed-gates-...`); this section is the written
doctrine those fail-closed-gate justifications point at.

## Watch loop and CI autofix

When CI fails after `git push`, `/ai-pr` step 14 enters its watch loop. The loop:

1. Pulls `gh pr checks` every 30 s (active phase) or 5 min (passive phase).
2. On a fixable failure, runs the matching auto-fix command from
   `gate-findings.json` (e.g., `ruff check --fix`, `ruff format`).
3. Re-pushes and waits for the next CI cycle.
4. Bounded by D-104-05: 30 min wall-clock cap on the active phase, 4 h cap on
   the passive phase, exit 90 if either cap fires.

The active-phase cap is "30 min since last fix action" -- not "30 min total" -- so
a long CI run that is steadily making progress will not get truncated.

## Risk acceptance for delegated checks

When the watch loop hits its cap with residual failures, it emits
`.ai-engineering/state/watch-residuals.json`. The schema is identical to
`gate-findings.json` (D-104-06): `{schema, session_id, produced_by:
"watch-loop", findings, ...}`.

`ai-eng risk accept-all <findings.json> --justification "..." --spec <spec-id>
--follow-up "..."` (spec-105 D-105-05) consumes this artefact, persists each
finding's `rule_id` to `state/decision-store.json` as a discrete `DEC-*`
entry sharing one `batch_id`, and unblocks the merge. Justification, spec
ref, and follow-up plan are all mandatory and surface in audit reports.

### Lookup flow (orchestrator-level, D-105-07)

After Wave 2 collects findings, the orchestrator calls
`ai_engineering.policy.checks._accept_lookup.apply_risk_acceptances(
findings, store, now=now)` which:

1. Builds canonical contexts of the form `f"finding:{rule_id}"` for each
   live finding.
2. Looks up each context in `state/decision-store.json` for an active
   (non-expired, non-revoked) risk-acceptance DEC entry.
3. Partitions findings into `(blocking, accepted)` lists. Accepted
   findings are dropped from the blocking set, surfaced separately in
   `gate-findings.json` v1.1 under `accepted_findings[]`, and emit a
   `category=risk-acceptance, control=finding-bypassed` telemetry event
   per acceptance.

The CLI prints a compact ACCEPTED table for each bypass plus an
`expiring_soon[]` banner when any DEC is within `_WARN_BEFORE_EXPIRY_DAYS`
(default 7) of expiry.

### Bulk acceptance (D-105-01)

`accept-all` accepts findings of any severity (including critical) in a
single pass. Per-finding TTLs follow `_SEVERITY_EXPIRY_DAYS` constants
(critical=15d, high=30d, medium=60d, low=90d). Each acceptance persists
its severity unchanged -- bulk acceptance is logged-acceptance, not
severity weakening.

### Dual-mode interaction (D-105-02 / D-105-03)

- **Regulated mode** (default): all gates run. Risk acceptances apply
  through `apply_risk_acceptances`; granted bypasses emit telemetry.
- **Prototyping mode**: Tier 2 governance checks skip; Tier 0+1 always
  block. Risk acceptances still apply for any finding that does run.
  Branch-aware escalation + CI override force regulated execution
  regardless of manifest, so prototyping cannot leak to protected
  branches or to CI runs.

See `.ai-engineering/contexts/risk-acceptance-flow.md` for the full
end-to-end lifecycle (accept / renew / resolve / revoke).

## Migration note

`AIENG_LEGACY_PIPELINE=1` env var restores the pre-spec-104 sequential local-only
behaviour for one session. Use it if the new orchestrator misbehaves and you need
a known-good fallback while filing an issue. The legacy path emits a deprecation
warning and does not write `gate-findings.json` (no schema contract).
